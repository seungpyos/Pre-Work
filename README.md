## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Here are some of my favorite applications: 
- Instagram:
    - Seasonal rotation of background images on the direct messages
    - Different forms of interaction such as reels, posts, or even their shop
- Twitter:
    - Availability to upload 30min+ videos
    - Personalized tweets based on your likes and saved 
- Youtube:
    - Interactive subcription button that allows you to keep up with your favorite creators
    - Various playback speed and captions implemented
## Notes

- First time with Swift, struggled between connecting button to logic in the beginning.
